# Glass

**Glass** is another esolang inspired by Brainfuck, its designed to be less syntax than Brainfuck
It uses only a handful of symbols to manipulate memory cells and print ASCII output.

## Features

- Compact syntax: `+ - ! < > .`
- Factorial operator (`!`)
- Copy and move mechanics using `+-` as copy current cell value and `+-+` as move current cell value
- Same as Brainfuck, everything else is ignored as comments
